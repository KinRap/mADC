        <p>Colin Hancock is determined to make the most of his second chance. With a troubled past marked by violence and poor choices, he's committed to turning his life around. Focused on earning his teaching degree and steering clear of past mistakes, Colin is steadfast in his resolve to avoid serious relationships.</p>
        <p>Maria Sanchez, the hardworking daughter of Mexican immigrants, appears to have achieved conventional success with a prestigious job at a law firm in Wilmington. Yet, beneath her outward success lies a history of trauma that has led her back to her hometown, prompting her to question her beliefs.</p>
        <p>A chance encounter on a rainy road sets Colin and Maria on a transformative journey, challenging their preconceived notions about each other and themselves. As they unexpectedly fall in love, they dare to imagine a future together—until shadows from Maria's past resurface, threatening their newfound happiness.</p>
        <p>Amidst escalating threats, Colin and Maria face a series of terrifying trials that put their relationship to the test. Will the ghosts of their pasts tear them apart, or will their love provide the strength they need to endure?</p>
        <p>Filled with suspense and emotion, "See Me" reminds us that love can emerge from the depths of crisis and that true understanding often comes from those who see us for who we truly are, even when it's not immediately apparent.</p>
