        <p>Trevor Benson didn't plan to return to his hometown of New Bern, North Carolina. However, after sustaining serious injuries from a mortar blast in Afghanistan, he finds himself back at his grandfather's old cabin, using it as a sanctuary to recover and contemplate his next steps.</p>
        <p>While tending to his grandfather's bee hives and preparing for a return to medical school, Trevor unexpectedly finds himself drawn to Natalie Masterson, a local deputy sheriff. Despite their undeniable connection, Natalie remains guarded, leaving Trevor puzzled about what she's keeping hidden.</p>
        <p>Adding to Trevor's challenges is the enigmatic presence of Callie, a withdrawn teenage girl living in a nearby trailer park. Claiming to be 17 years old, Callie works at a local store but keeps to herself. Trevor suspects that Callie may hold the key to unraveling the mystery surrounding his grandfather's death, especially since she had a connection to him in the past.</p>
        <p>As Trevor delves deeper into Natalie and Callie's secrets, he uncovers unexpected truths about love, forgiveness, and the interconnectedness of past and present. In his journey to uncover the truth, Trevor learns that sometimes, in order to move forward, we must confront the past and return to where it all began.</p>
