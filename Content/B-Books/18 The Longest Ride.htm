        <p>Ira Levinson, a ninety-one-year-old man in poor health and without any family, finds himself stranded on a desolate embankment after a car accident. Despite his injuries, he struggles to stay conscious, only to be comforted by the apparition of his late wife Ruth. Though he knows she cannot be physically present, he clings to her words as she recounts the cherished moments of their life together, from their first meeting to the challenges they faced during WWII.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, at a bull-riding event nearby, Sophia Danko, a college senior reeling from a recent breakup, crosses paths with Luke, a rugged cowboy who offers her a glimpse into a world vastly different from her own. As Sophia and Luke fall in love, she envisions a future divergent from her plans, one that Luke has the power to shape—provided a hidden truth doesn't tear them apart.</p>
        <p>Despite their differences in age and background, the lives of Ira and Ruth intertwine with those of Sophia and Luke, showcasing the unexpected paths that love can take. Their stories serve as a poignant reminder that even amidst despair and loss, the human heart can embark on extraordinary journeys, transcending barriers of time and experience.</p>
