        <p>In the spring of 1984, high school sweethearts Amanda Collier and Dawson Cole found themselves deeply enamored with each other. Despite their differing backgrounds in the small town of Oriental, North Carolina, their love appeared to transcend societal barriers. However, as their senior year drew to a close, unforeseen circumstances tore them apart, leading them down separate paths.</p>
        <p>Now, twenty-five years later, Amanda and Dawson are brought back to Oriental for the funeral of Tuck Hostetler, their former mentor who once sheltered their youthful romance. Neither has lived the life they envisioned, and neither can forget the passionate love they shared. As they fulfill Tuck's final wishes, they come to realize that their perceptions of Tuck, themselves, and their dreams were not entirely accurate. Confronted with painful memories, the former lovers must confront the truths about the choices they made. Over the course of a poignant weekend, they grapple with the question: Can love truly rewrite the past?</p>
