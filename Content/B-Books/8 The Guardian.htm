        <p>Julie Barenson's late husband left her two unexpected gifts: a puppy named Singer and the assurance that he would always watch over her. Now, four years later, Julie, at twenty-nine, feels too young to give up on love. She considers opening her heart again, but she faces a dilemma: should she choose Richard Franklin, a sophisticated and charming engineer who treats her like royalty, or Mike Harris, her husband's loyal best friend and a down-to-earth nice guy?</p>
        <p>Julie believes that choosing one of them will bring her the happiness she has been longing for. However, her life takes a terrifying turn when she becomes ensnared in a nightmare fueled by deception and jealousy so toxic that it turns deadly.</p>
        <p>In "The Guardian," Nicholas Sparks delivers his trademark qualities, but with an added layer of electrifying intensity and riveting suspense.</p>
