        <p>Miles Ryan's world shattered the day his wife was killed in a hit-and-run accident two years ago. Missy had been his first and only love, and Miles is convinced she would have been his last. As a deputy in the town of New Bern, North Carolina, Miles not only mourns Missy's loss but also seeks justice for her death.</p>
        <p>Then Miles meets Sarah Andrews, the second-grade teacher of his son, Jonah. Sarah had relocated from Baltimore after a difficult divorce, seeking solace in the calm atmosphere of New Bern. Perhaps it's her own past pain that makes her attuned to the sorrow she sees in Jonah's eyes, and later in Miles's.</p>
        <p>Gradually, Sarah and Miles connect with each other. They find themselves laughing again for the first time in years and falling in love. However, they could never have imagined the shocking secret that binds them, forcing them to reevaluate everything they thought they knew and ultimately leading them to a heart-wrenching decision that will alter their lives forever.</p>
        <p>In "A Bend in the Road," Nicholas Sparks delves into life's twists and turns with poignant depth. His message resonates with a powerful lesson on human imperfection, the mistakes we make, and the profound joy that comes from embracing love.</p>
