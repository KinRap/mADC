        <p>Seventeen-year-old Veronica "Ronnie" Miller's world was shattered when her parents divorced and her father relocated from New York City to Wilmington, North Carolina. Three years later, Ronnie remains resentful and distant from her parents, particularly her father, until her mother decides that spending the summer in Wilmington with him would be beneficial for everyone.</p>
        <p>Ronnie's father, a former concert pianist and teacher, now leads a quiet life in the coastal town, engrossed in creating a masterpiece for a local church. As Ronnie reluctantly settles into her summer in Wilmington, a poignant tale unfolds—one that explores love in its myriad forms, including first love and the bond between parents and children. Through the intricate narrative, Nicholas Sparks showcases the profound impact of deeply felt relationships, illustrating how they can both break our hearts and ultimately bring healing.</p>
