        <p>Colby Mills, once destined for a musical career, now runs a small family farm in North Carolina. Seeking a break from his daily responsibilities, he spontaneously takes a gig playing at a bar in St. Pete’s Beach, Florida. There, he meets Morgan Lee, whose presence turns his world upside-down and makes him question the path he's chosen. Morgan, the daughter of wealthy Chicago doctors, dreams of becoming a music star in Nashville after graduating from a prestigious college music program. Colby and Morgan find themselves completing each other romantically and musically in ways they never imagined. As they fall deeply in love, they face challenges that test their relationship and their dreams.</p>
